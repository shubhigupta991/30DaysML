## Data Science

`Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.`

`The practice of data science requires the use of machine learning frameworks extensively. ... Framework focused solutions mean data scientists don't always need to have extensive experience in coding and programming languages, and can instead use their expertise in solving bigger problems on their table.`

Here we are dealing with various python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, scikit learn
